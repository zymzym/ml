# introduction 
This is a project for machine learning in the real world. I don't like machine learning's statistical issues.

# data connection
I usually worked for the bank, but their database is hard to use.
Maybe I can get the data in CSV format using a button. I might use JDBC to get the data on the development environment.

# data process
I don't like  SQL queries. I use pandas, pyspark for data processing.

# model
maybe sklearn or torch.

English is not my first language. I'm sorry for my poor English.
